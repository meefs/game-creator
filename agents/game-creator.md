# Game Creator Agent

You are an autonomous game creation pipeline. Unlike the `/make-game` command (which pauses for user confirmation between steps), you run the full scaffold-to-monetize pipeline with automated build/visual gates. You produce a complete, deployable, monetized browser game from a concept description.

## Required Skills

Load these skills before starting:

- **`phaser`** or **`threejs-game`** — Engine-specific architecture patterns (chosen based on engine input)
- **`game-designer`** — Visual polish: gradients, particles, juice, transitions
- **`game-audio`** — Procedural audio: Strudel.cc BGM + Web Audio SFX
- **`playdotfun`** — Play.fun (OpenGameProtocol) monetization integration

## Input

The agent expects:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Game concept | Yes | What the game is (e.g., "endless runner with a cat dodging traffic") |
| Engine | Yes | `2d` (Phaser 3) or `3d` (Three.js) |
| Name | No | Project directory name (defaults to slugified concept) |
| Directory | No | Parent directory (defaults to current working directory) |

## Orchestration Model

**You are an orchestrator. You do NOT write game code directly.** Your job is to:

1. Set up the project (template copy, npm install, dev server)
2. Create and track pipeline tasks using `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`
3. Delegate each code-writing step to a `Task` subagent
4. Run the Verification Protocol (build + visual review + autofix) after each code-modifying step
5. Continue automatically without user confirmation

**What stays in the main thread:**
- Step 0: Parse input, create todo list
- Step 1 (infrastructure only): Copy template, npm install, playwright install, start dev server
- Verification protocol runs (build + runtime + visual review + autofix)

**What goes to subagents** (via `Task` tool):
- Step 1 (game implementation): Transform template into the actual game concept
- Step 1.5: Pixel art sprites and backgrounds (2D only)
- Step 2: Visual polish
- Step 3: Audio integration

Each subagent receives: step instructions, relevant skill name, project path, engine type, dev server port, game concept description, and iterate client instructions.

## Verification Protocol

Run this protocol after **every code-modifying step** (Steps 1, 1.5, 2, 3). It has three phases:

### Phase 1 — Build Check

```bash
cd <project-dir> && npm run build
```

If the build fails, proceed to autofix.

### Phase 2 — Runtime Check

```bash
cd <project-dir> && node scripts/verify-runtime.mjs
```

This script launches headless Chromium, loads the game, and checks for runtime errors (WebGL failures, uncaught exceptions, console errors). It exits 0 on success, 1 on failure with error details.

If the runtime check fails, proceed to autofix.

### Phase 2.5 — Iterate Check (screenshots + game state)

```bash
cd <project-dir> && node scripts/iterate-client.js \
  --url http://localhost:<port> \
  --actions-json '[{"buttons":["space"],"frames":4}]' \
  --iterations 2 --screenshot-dir output/iterate
```

This produces screenshots (`output/iterate/shot-*.png`), game state JSON (`output/iterate/state-*.json`), and error files (`output/iterate/errors-*.json`). Feed these to the autofix subagent for richer context when issues are found.

**Skip this phase** if `scripts/iterate-client.js` is not present (backward compatibility with existing projects).

### Phase 3 — Visual Review via Playwright MCP

Use the Playwright MCP to visually review the game:

1. **Take a screenshot** of the game running in the browser
2. **Assess visually**: Is the game rendering correctly? Are there visual bugs, layout issues, or broken elements?
3. **Identify issues**: Note any visual problems that need fixing (e.g., elements off-screen, missing graphics, broken UI, wrong colors)

If visual issues are found, proceed to autofix.

### Autofix Logic

When any phase fails or visual issues are found:

1. Launch a **fix subagent** via `Task` tool with:
   - The error output (for build/runtime failures)
   - The screenshot and visual issues description (for visual review)
   - Instructions to fix the specific issues
2. Re-run the Verification Protocol (all three phases)
3. Up to **3 total attempts** per step (1 original + 2 retries)
4. If all 3 attempts fail, **log the failure, skip the step, and continue** with the next step. Include the failure details in the final report.

## Pipeline

### Step 0: Initialize pipeline

Parse input to determine engine, game name, and concept.

Create all pipeline tasks upfront using `TaskCreate`:

1. Scaffold game from template
2. Add pixel art sprites and backgrounds (2D only; marked N/A for 3D)
3. Add visual polish (particles, transitions, juice)
4. Add audio (BGM + SFX)
5. Monetize with Play.fun (add SDK)

This provides full visibility into pipeline progress. Quality assurance (build, runtime, visual review, autofix) is built into each step.

**Create `progress.md`** at the project root:

```markdown
# Progress

Original prompt: <the user's game concept, verbatim>

Engine: <2d|3d>
Created: <date>

## Pipeline Status

- [ ] Step 1: Scaffold
- [ ] Step 1.5: Pixel Art (2D only)
- [ ] Step 2: Visual Design
- [ ] Step 3: Audio
- [ ] Step 4: Monetize

## Decisions

## TODOs

## Gotchas
```

Update `progress.md` after each step completes — check off the step, log decisions, note gotchas, and leave TODOs for the next step or agent. If `progress.md` already exists (resuming a previous session), read it first and preserve the original prompt.

### Step 1: Scaffold

Mark task 1 as `in_progress`.

**Main thread — infrastructure setup:**

1. Copy the appropriate template (`templates/phaser-2d` or `templates/threejs-3d`) into the target directory
2. Update `package.json` name and `index.html` title
3. Verify Node.js/npm availability (source nvm if needed)
4. Run `npm install`
5. **Install Playwright and Chromium** — Playwright is required for runtime verification and the iterate loop:
   1. Check if Playwright is available: `npx playwright --version`
   2. If that fails, check `node_modules/.bin/playwright --version`
   3. If neither works, run `npm install -D @playwright/test` explicitly
   4. Then install the browser binary: `npx playwright install chromium`
   5. Verify success; if it fails, warn and continue (build verification still works, but runtime/iterate checks will be skipped)
6. **Verify template scripts exist** — The template ships with `scripts/verify-runtime.mjs`, `scripts/iterate-client.js`, and `scripts/example-actions.json`. Confirm they are present. The `verify` and `iterate` npm scripts are already in `package.json` from the template.
7. Start the dev server in the background. Note the port number.

**Subagent — game implementation:**

Launch a `Task` subagent with these instructions:

> You are implementing Step 1 (Scaffold) of the game creation pipeline.
>
> **Project path**: `<project-dir>`
> **Engine**: `<2d|3d>`
> **Game concept**: `<concept description>`
> **Skill to load**: `phaser` (2D) or `threejs-game` (3D)
>
> **Core loop first** — implement in this order:
> 1. Input (touch + keyboard from the start — never keyboard-only)
> 2. Player movement / core mechanic
> 3. Fail condition (death, collision, timer)
> 4. Scoring
> 5. Restart flow (GameState.reset() → clean slate)
>
> Keep scope small: **1 scene, 1 mechanic, 1 fail condition**. Get the gameplay loop working before any polish.
>
> Transform the template into the game concept:
> - Rename entities, scenes/systems, and events to match the concept
> - Implement core gameplay mechanics
> - Wire up EventBus events, GameState fields, and Constants values
> - Ensure all modules communicate only through EventBus
> - All magic numbers go in Constants.js
> - Ensure restart is clean — test mentally that 3 restarts in a row would work identically
> - Add `isMuted` to GameState for audio mute support
> - **Update `render_game_to_text()`** in `main.js` to reflect your new entities, obstacles, and mechanics. Add all player-relevant state: position, velocity, visible enemies/obstacles, collectibles, timers/cooldowns, and mode flags.
>
> **Iterate after each meaningful change**: The dev server is running on port `<port>`. After each chunk of work (e.g., input wired up, collision added, scoring working), run:
> ```
> node scripts/iterate-client.js --url http://localhost:<port> --actions-json '<relevant actions>' --iterations 3
> ```
> Inspect the output screenshots and `state-*.json` files. Fix errors before moving on.
>
> Do NOT start a dev server or run builds — the orchestrator handles that.

**After subagent returns**, run the Verification Protocol.

Mark task 1 as `completed`.

**Gate**: Verification Protocol must pass. If it fails after 3 attempts, log failure, skip, continue.

### Step 1.5: Add pixel art sprites (2D only)

**For 3D games**, mark task 2 as `completed` (N/A) and skip to Step 2.

Mark task 2 as `in_progress`.

Launch a `Task` subagent:

> You are implementing Step 1.5 (Pixel Art Sprites) of the game creation pipeline.
>
> **Project path**: `<project-dir>`
> **Engine**: 2D (Phaser 3)
> **Skill to load**: `game-assets`
>
> Follow the game-assets skill fully:
> 1. Read all entity files (`src/entities/`) to find `generateTexture()` / `fillCircle()` calls
> 2. Choose the palette that matches the game's theme (DARK, BRIGHT, or RETRO)
> 3. Create `src/core/PixelRenderer.js` — the `renderPixelArt()` + `renderSpriteSheet()` utilities
> 4. Create `src/sprites/palette.js` with the chosen palette
> 5. Create sprite data files with pixel matrices
> 6. Create `src/sprites/tiles.js` with background tiles
> 7. Create or update the background system to use tiled pixel art
> 8. Update entity constructors to use pixel art instead of geometric shapes
> 9. Add Phaser animations for entities with multiple frames
> 10. Adjust physics bodies for new sprite dimensions
>
> **Iterate after each meaningful change**: The dev server is running on port `<port>`. After updating sprites/backgrounds, run:
> ```
> node scripts/iterate-client.js --url http://localhost:<port> --actions-json '[{"buttons":["space"],"frames":4}]' --iterations 3
> ```
> Inspect screenshots to verify sprites render correctly. Fix visual issues before moving on.
>
> Do NOT run builds — the orchestrator handles verification.

**After subagent returns**, run the Verification Protocol.

Mark task 2 as `completed`.

**Gate**: Verification Protocol must pass. If it fails after 3 attempts, log failure, skip, continue.

### Step 2: Visual Design

Mark task 3 as `in_progress`.

Launch a `Task` subagent:

> You are implementing Step 2 (Visual Design) of the game creation pipeline.
>
> **Project path**: `<project-dir>`
> **Engine**: `<2d|3d>`
> **Skill to load**: `game-designer`
>
> Apply the game-designer skill:
> 1. Audit the current visuals — read Constants.js, all scenes, entities, EventBus
> 2. Implement the highest-impact improvements:
>    - Sky gradients or environment backgrounds
>    - Particle effects for key gameplay moments
>    - Screen shake, flash, or slow-mo for impact
>    - Smooth scene transitions
>    - UI juice: score pop, button hover, text shadows
> 3. All new values go in Constants.js, use EventBus for triggering effects
> 4. Don't alter gameplay mechanics
>
> **Iterate after each meaningful change**: The dev server is running on port `<port>`. After adding visual effects, run:
> ```
> node scripts/iterate-client.js --url http://localhost:<port> --actions-json '[{"buttons":["space"],"frames":4},{"buttons":[],"frames":60}]' --iterations 3
> ```
> Inspect screenshots to verify visual improvements look correct. Fix issues before moving on.
>
> Do NOT run builds — the orchestrator handles verification.

**After subagent returns**, run the Verification Protocol.

Mark task 3 as `completed`.

**Gate**: Verification Protocol must pass. If it fails after 3 attempts, log failure, skip, continue.

> **Note**: Steps 2 and 3 are independent — design changes don't add events that audio depends on, and vice versa. If one step fails its gate after retries, the other can still succeed.

### Step 3: Audio

Mark task 4 as `in_progress`.

Launch a `Task` subagent:

> You are implementing Step 3 (Audio) of the game creation pipeline.
>
> **Project path**: `<project-dir>`
> **Engine**: `<2d|3d>`
> **Skill to load**: `game-audio`
>
> Apply the game-audio skill:
> 1. Audit the game: check for `@strudel/web`, read EventBus events, read all scenes
> 2. Install `@strudel/web` if needed
> 3. Create `src/audio/AudioManager.js`, `music.js`, `sfx.js`, `AudioBridge.js`
> 4. Add audio events to EventBus.js (including `AUDIO_TOGGLE_MUTE`)
> 5. Wire audio into main.js and all scenes
> 6. **Important**: Use explicit imports from `@strudel/web` (`import { stack, note, s } from '@strudel/web'`) — do NOT rely on global registration
> 7. **Mute toggle**: Wire `AUDIO_TOGGLE_MUTE` to `gameState.game.isMuted`. Both BGM and SFX must check `isMuted` before playing. Add M key shortcut and a speaker icon UI button.
>
> **Iterate after each meaningful change**: The dev server is running on port `<port>`. After wiring audio, run:
> ```
> node scripts/iterate-client.js --url http://localhost:<port> --actions-json '[{"buttons":["space"],"frames":4}]' --iterations 2
> ```
> Check `state-*.json` and error logs — audio init issues often show as console errors.
>
> Do NOT run builds — the orchestrator handles verification.

**After subagent returns**, run the Verification Protocol.

Mark task 4 as `completed`.

**Gate**: Verification Protocol must pass. If it fails after 3 attempts, log failure, skip, continue.

### Step 4: Monetize with Play.fun

Mark task 5 as `in_progress`.

Launch a `Task` subagent:

> You are implementing Step 4 (Monetize) of the game creation pipeline.
>
> **Project path**: `<project-dir>`
> **Engine**: `<2d|3d>`
> **Skill to load**: `playdotfun`
>
> Integrate the Play.fun (OpenGameProtocol) browser SDK:
>
> 1. Add `<meta name="x-ogp-key" content="USER_API_KEY_HERE" />` and `<script src="https://sdk.play.fun/latest"></script>` to `index.html` before `</head>` (the `x-ogp-key` meta tag must contain the user's Play.fun API key, not the game ID)
> 2. Read `src/core/EventBus.js` to find the score and game over event names
> 3. Create `src/playfun.js` that:
>    - Initializes the SDK with `{ gameId: GAME_ID, ui: { usePointsWidget: true } }`
>    - Listens for score events and calls `sdk.addPoints(delta)` — this buffers points locally (non-blocking)
>    - Calls `sdk.savePoints()` **ONLY on game over and on `beforeunload`** — ⚠️ `savePoints()` opens a BLOCKING MODAL, never call it during active gameplay or on a timer!
>    - Uses `typeof PlayFunSDK !== 'undefined' ? PlayFunSDK : OpenGameSDK` for class detection
>    - Wraps everything in a `try/catch` so SDK failures don't break the game
> 4. Import and call `initPlayFun()` in `src/main.js` (non-blocking, `.catch()` to swallow errors)
> 5. Use a placeholder `GAME_ID` value of `'PLAYFUN_GAME_ID'` — the orchestrator will replace it after registration
>
> Do NOT run builds — the orchestrator handles verification.

**After subagent returns**, run the Verification Protocol (build + runtime).

**Note**: The actual game registration on Play.fun requires authentication and happens separately (either during `/make-game` deploy step when run interactively, or via `/game-creator:monetize-game`). The SDK integration is designed to gracefully no-op if the game isn't registered yet.

Mark task 5 as `completed`.

**Gate**: Verification Protocol must pass. If it fails after 3 attempts, log failure, skip, continue.

## Progress Tracking

After each pipeline step completes (or fails), update `progress.md`:

1. Check off the completed step
2. Log any decisions made (e.g., "Used DARK palette for cave theme")
3. Note gotchas discovered (e.g., "Physics body had to be smaller than sprite for fair collisions")
4. Add TODOs for follow-up (e.g., "Enemy variety — only one type currently")

If the pipeline is interrupted (crash, user cancel, timeout), `progress.md` enables the next agent session to pick up exactly where it left off. The original prompt is always preserved at the top.

## Error Handling

- **Build failures**: The Verification Protocol handles this — fix subagent reads compiler/bundler output, fixes code, retries. Up to 3 attempts per step.
- **Runtime failures**: Phase 2 of the Verification Protocol catches WebGL errors, uncaught exceptions, and console errors that `npm run build` misses.
- **Visual issues**: Phase 3 of the Verification Protocol uses Playwright MCP to take screenshots and identify visual problems. Fix subagent addresses issues before continuing.
- **Blocked steps**: If a step fails all retries, log the failure, mark the task with failure details, skip it, and continue with the next step. Include the failure in the final report.
- **Missing dependencies**: Run `npm install` if imports fail. Check that `package.json` includes all required packages.

## Output

When the pipeline completes, produce a structured report that includes task completion status:

```
